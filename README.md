# Anchor-oriented Multi-Robot Coverage without Global Localization
It is a Robotraium package that implements a Anchor-oriented Multi-Robot Coverage without Global Localization. It uses anchor oriented multi-robot coverage using for relative localization. This package contains Robotarium python codes:

  - AOC Coverage
  - AOC with dynamic AP


## Installation Requirements
* C++ requirements.   
([pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) is also required, but it's built into this repository; you don't need to install)
* python 3.6+
* [Robotarium Installation](https://pypi.org/project/robotarium-python-simulator/) is required for the Robotarium simulation

## 1. Setup:
Clone the packge to your local directory and navigate to mr-aoc directory inside the package.

## 1. Simulation:
Run the robotarium script for mr-aoc for covergae as:

``` python3 executeCoverageScript.py ```

Run the robotarium script for mr-aoc for dynamic AP as:

``` python3 executeCoverageScript_dynamicAP.py ```
